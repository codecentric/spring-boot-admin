# Contributing to Spring Boot Admin
Contributions are highly welcome. Feel free to submit Pull Requests. Maybe watch out for tickets tagged with `ideal-for-contribution`, these tickets should always be a good starting point for contributing.

You can find some hints for starting development in the [README](spring-boot-admin-server-ui/README.md) of `spring-boot-admin-server-ui`.

## Coding Conventions
### Java / Server
We try to satisfy the [Code Style of Spring Framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style).

The [Spring Java Format Plugin](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat) is added to the build. Checkstyle will enforce the consistency of the code. Nevertheless there are some disabled rules, due to backward compatibility. You can find these disabled rules in a comment in `src/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`.

However, you can always run `mvn spring-javaformat:apply` to fix some basic errors, like indentation.

### JavaScript / Client
The Vue frontend implements basic prettier rules as well as Vue3 recommended rules.
To check if there are any violations run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.
Append `:fix` to let eslint or prettier auto-solve most issues.

## Working with the code
### IntelliJ
The IntelliJ settings are based on the IntelliJ-IDEA-Editor-Settings from spring, but have been adapted slightly, you can find the original settings [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/IntelliJ-IDEA-Editor-Settings).
The custom settings are stored in `.editorconfig` and are imported automatically by IntelliJ.
If you are using IntelliJ, there is also a [formatter-plugin provided by Spring](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat#intellij-idea).
(i) Plugin version x didn't not work in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2020.3.

#### Checkstyle Plugin
This plugin scans Java files with the project's custom CheckStyle rules from within IDEA.
Install and configure the Checkstyle Plugin, and enable the configuration file.

##### Configuration

1. Preferences > Tools > Checkstyle > Third-Party Checks
1. Add `~/.m2/repository/io/spring/javaformat/spring-javaformat-checkstyle/0.0.26/spring-javaformat-checkstyle-0.0.26.jar`

##### Configuration File
Add the configuration file and enabled it:
1. Preferences > Tools > Checkstyle > Configuration File > +
1. Add a Name, ex. Spring Boot Admin
1. Use a local Checkstyle File, Browse to `src/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` and click Next
1. Enter the full path to the checkstyle header file: `<git repo>/src/checkstyle/checkstyle-header.txt`, click Finish
