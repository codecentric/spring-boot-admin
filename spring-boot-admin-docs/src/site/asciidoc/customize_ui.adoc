== Linking / Embedding External Pages in Navbar ==

Links will be opened in a new window/tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`) having no access
to opener and referrer (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`).

=== Simple link ===
To add a simple link to an external page, use the following snippet.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=customization-external-views-simple-link]
----

<1> The label will be shown in the navbar
<2> URL to the page you want to link to
<3> Order that allows to specify position of item in navbar

=== Dropdown with links ===
To aggregate links below a single element, dropdowns can be configured as follows.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=customization-external-views-dropdown-with-links]
----

=== Dropdown as link having links as children ===
[source,yaml,indent=0]

[[customizing-custom-views]]
== Custom Views ==

It is possible to add custom views to the ui.
The views must be implemented as https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js] components.

The JavaScript-Bundle and CSS-Stylesheet must be placed on the classpath at `/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/extensions/{name}/` so the server can pick them up.
The {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/[spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui] module contains a sample which has the necessary maven setup to build such a module.

The custom extension registers itself by calling:

[source,javascript]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/index.js[tags=customization-ui-toplevel]
----

<1> Name of the view and the route.
<2> Path in Vue router.
<3> The imported custom component, which will be rendered on the route.
<4> An optional group name that allows to bind views to a logical group (defaults to "none")
<5> The handle for the custom view to be shown in the top navigation bar.
<6> Order for the view.
<7> Using `i18n.mergeLocaleMessage` allows to add custom translations.

Views in the top navigation bar are sorted by ascending order.

If new top level routes are added to the frontend, they also must be known to the backend.
Add a `/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/extensions/{name}/routes.txt` with all your new toplevel routes (one route per line).

Groups are used in instance sidebar to aggregate multiple views into a collapsible menu entry showing the group's name.
When a group contains just a single element, the label of the view is shown instead of the group's name.

==== Override/Set custom group icons ====
In order to override or set icons for (custom) groups you can use the `SBA.viewRegistry.setGroupIcon` function as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/index.js[tags=customization-ui-groups]
----
<1> Name of the group to set icon for
<2> Arbitrary HTML code (e.g. SVG image) that is inserted and parsed as icon.

[[customizing-custom-views-top-level]]
==== Adding a Top-Level View ====

Here is a simple top level view just listing all registered applications:
[source,html]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/custom.vue[lines=17..-1]
----

<1> By destructuring `applications` of `SBA.useApplicationStore()`, you have reactive access to registered applications.

TIP: There are some helpful methods on the application and instances object available.
Have a look at {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/services/application.ts[application.ts] and {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/services/instance.ts[instance.ts]

And this is how you register the top-level view.

===== Example

[source,javascript]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/index.js[tags=customization-ui-child]
----

<1> References the name of the parent view.
<2> Router path used to navigate to.
<3> Define whether the path should be registered as child route in parent's route.
When set to `true`, the parent component has to implement `<router-view>`

The `routes.txt` config with the added route:
[source,text]

----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/routes.txt[]
----

[[customizing-custom-views-instance]]
=== Visualizing a Custom Endpoint ===

Here is a view to show a custom endpoint:
[source,html]

----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/custom-endpoint.vue[lines=17..-1]
----

<1> If you define a `instance` prop the component will receive the instance the view should be rendered for.
<2> Each instance has a preconfigured https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] instance to access the endpoints with the correct path and headers.

Registering the instance view works like for the top-level view with some additional properties:

[source,javascript]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/index.js[tags=customization-ui-endpoint]
----

<1> The parent must be 'instances' in order to render the new custom view for a single instance.
<2> You can group views by assigning them to a group.
<3> If you add a `isEnabled` callback you can figure out dynamically if the view should be show for the particular instance.

NOTE: You can override default views by putting the same group and name as the one you want to override.

=== Customizing Header Logo and Title ===

You can set custom information in the header (i.e. displaying staging information or company name) by using following configuration properties:

- **spring.boot.admin.ui.brand**: This HTML snippet is rendered in navigation header and defaults to `<img src="assets/img/icon-spring-boot-admin.svg"><span>Spring Boot Admin</span>`.
By default it shows the SBA logo followed by it's name.
If you want to show a custom logo you can set: `spring.boot.admin.ui.brand=<img src="custom/custom-icon.png">`.
Either you just add the image to your jar-file in `/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/` (SBA registers a `ResourceHandler` for this location by default), or you must ensure yourself that the image gets served correctly (e.g. by registering your own `ResourceHandler`)

- **spring.boot.admin.ui.title**: Use this option to customize the browsers window title.

== Customizing Colors ==

You can provide a custom color theme to the application by overwriting the following properties:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet/src/main/resources/application-themed.yml[]
----

|===
| Property name | Default | Usage

| `spring.boot.admin.ui.theme.color`
| `#42d3a5`
| Used in `meta` tag for setting theme color for user agents. Used to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user interface.

| `spring.boot.admin.ui.theme.background-enabled`
| `true`
| Disable background image in UI

| `spring.boot.admin.ui.theme.palette.[50,100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900]`
| ``
50: #E8FBEF
100: #D0F7DF
200: #A1EFBD
300: #71E69C
400: #41DE7B
500: #22C55E
600: #1A9547
700: #116530
800: #09351A
900: #010603
``
| Define a color palette that affects the colors in sidebar view
(e.g shade `600` of palette is used as text color and shade `50` as background color.)

|===

== Customizing Login Logo ==

You can set a custom image to be displayed on the login page.

1. Put the image in a resource location which is served via http (e.g. `/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/assets/img/`).
2. Configure the icons to use using the following property:
- **spring.boot.admin.ui.login-icon**: Used as icon on login page. (e.g `assets/img/custom-login-icon.svg`)

== Customizing Favicon ==

It is possible to use a custom favicon, which is also used for desktop notifications.
Spring Boot Admin uses a different icon when one or more application is down.

1. Put the favicon (`.png` with at least 192x192 pixels) in a resource location which is served via http (e.g. `/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/assets/img/`).

2. Configure the icons to use using the following properties:
- `spring.boot.admin.ui.favicon`: Used as default icon. (e.g `assets/img/custom-favicon.png`
- `spring.boot.admin.ui.favicon-danger`: Used when one or more service is down. (e.g `assets/img/custom-favicon-danger.png`)

== Customizing Available Languages ==

To filter languages to a subset of all supported languages:

- **spring.boot.admin.ui.available-languages**: Used as a filter of existing languages. (e.g `en,de` out of existing `de,en,fr,ko,pt-BR,ru,zh`)

== Show / Hide views ==

You can very simply hide views in the navbar:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-servlet/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=customization-view-settings]
----

== Hide Service URL ==
To hide service URLs in Spring Boot Admin UI entirely, set the following property in your Server's configuration:

|===
| Property name | Default | Usage

| `spring.boot.admin.ui.hide-instance-url`
| `false`
| Set to `true` to hide service URLs as well as actions that require them in UI (e.g. jump to /health or /actuator).

|===

If you want to hide the URL for specific instances oncly, you can set the `hide-url` property in the instance metadata while registering a service.
When using Spring Boot Admin Client you can set the property `spring.boot.admin.client.metadata.hide-url=true` in the corresponding config file.
The value set in `metadata` does not have any effect, when the URLs are disabled in Server.
