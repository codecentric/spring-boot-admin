# Spring Boot Admin Client

The Spring Boot Admin Client is a Spring Boot Starter that registers itself with the Spring Boot Admin Server to
enable monitoring and management. By including the Spring Boot Admin Client Starter dependency in your application, the
Spring Boot Admin Server can access health, metrics, and other management endpoints, depending on which
Actuator endpoints are accessible.

## Properties

import metadata from "../../../../../spring-boot-admin-client/target/classes/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json";
import { PropertyTable } from "../../src/components/PropertyTable";
