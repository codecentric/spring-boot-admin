# Customizing

Spring Boot Admin provides flexibility for customizing the appearance and branding of the Admin Serverâ€™s user interface. This allows you to tailor the UI to match your organization's branding, improve usability, or add custom functionality.

You can easily modify key elements like logos, themes, and even extend the UI with custom views or components. The customization options include:

 * **Custom Logos and Branding**: Replace the default Spring Boot Admin logo with your own branding assets.
 * **Theming**: Customize colors, fonts, and layout styles using custom CSS or by modifying the theme properties.
 * **Custom Views**: Add new pages or extend existing ones by integrating custom JavaScript and HTML components.
 * **Localization**: Support multiple languages by adding custom translations for the UI.

By leveraging these customization options, you can create a tailored experience that aligns with your project or organization's needs, while still retaining the powerful monitoring and management capabilities of Spring Boot Admin.
