=== Clustering ===
Spring Boot Admin Server supports cluster replication via Hazelcast. It is automatically enabled when a `HazelcastConfig`- or `HazelcastInstance`-Bean is present. You can also configure the Hazelcast instance to be persistent, to keep the status over restarts.
Also have a look at the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-hazelcast/[Spring Boot support for Hazelcast].

. Add Hazelcast to your dependencies:
+
[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-hazelcast/pom.xml[tags=dependency-hazelcast,indent=0]
----

. Instantiate a HazelcastConfig:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-hazelcast/src/main/java/de/codecentric/boot/admin/SpringBootAdminHazelcastApplication.java[tags=application-hazelcast]
----
