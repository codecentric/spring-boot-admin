== What is Spring Boot Admin? ==

Spring Boot Admin is a application to manage and monitor your http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot Applications].
The applications register with our Spring Boot Admin Client (via HTTP) or are discovered using Spring Cloud (e.g. Eureka).
The UI is just an AngularJs application on top of the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
