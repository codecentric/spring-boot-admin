== What is Spring Boot Admin? ==

Spring Boot Admin is a simple application to manage and monitor your http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot Applications].
The applications register with our Spring Boot Admin Client (via http) or are discovered using Spring Cloud (e.g. Eureka).
The UI is just an Angular.js application on top of the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. In case you want to use the more advanced features (e.g. jmx-, loglevel-management), Jolokia must be included in the client application.
