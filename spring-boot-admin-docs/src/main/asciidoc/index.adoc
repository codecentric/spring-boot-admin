== What is Spring Boot Admin? ==

codecentric's Spring Boot Admin is a community project to manage and monitor your http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] ^(R)^ applications.
The applications register with our Spring Boot Admin Client (via HTTP) or are discovered using Spring Cloud ^(R)^ (e.g. Eureka, Consul).
The UI is just a Vue.js application on top of the Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.

Support for Python applications is available using https://github.com/SolarEdgeTech/pyctuator[Pyctuator].
