=== Custom Notifiers ===

You can add your own Notifiers by adding Spring Beans which implement the `Notifier` interface, at best by extending
`AbstractEventNotifier` or `AbstractStatusChangeNotifier`

=== Injecting Custom HTTP Headers ===

In case you need to inject custom HTTP headers into the requests made to the monitored application's actuator endpoints you can easily add a `HttpHeadersProvider`:

=== Intercepting Requests And Responses ===

You can intercept and modify requests and responses made to the monitored application's actuator endpoints by implementing the `InstanceExchangeFilterFunction` interface.
This can be useful for auditing or adding some extra security checks.

[[customizing-custom-views]]
=== Custom Views ===

It is possible to add custom views to the ui. The views must be implemented as https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js] components.

The Javascript-Bundle and Css-Stlysheet must be placed on the classpath at `/META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/extensions/{name}/` so the server can pick them up.
The {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/[spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui] module contains a sample which has the necessary maven setup to build such a module.

The custom extension registers itself by calling `SBA.use()` and need to expose a `install()` function, which is called by the ui when setting up the routes.
The `install()` function receives a parameter object referencing the {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/viewRegistry.js[viewRegistry] and the {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/store.js[applicationStore] in order to register views and/or callbacks.

[[customizing-custom-views-top-level]]
==== Adding a Top-Level View ====

Here is a simple top level view just listing all registered applications:
[source,html]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/custom.vue[lines=17..-1]
----
<1> If you define a `applications` prop the component will receive all registered applications.

TIP: There are some helpful methods on the application and instances object available. Have a look at {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/services/application.js[application.js] and {github-src}/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/src/main/frontend/services/instance.js[instance.js]

And this is how you register the top-level view.
[source,javascript]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/index.js[tags=customization-ui-toplevel]
----
<1> Name of the view and the route to the view
<2> Path where the view will be accessible
<3> The imported custom component, which will be rendered on the route.
<4> The label for the custom view to be shown in the top navigation bar.
<5> Order for the view. Views in the top navigation bar are sorted by ascending order.

[[customizing-custom-views-instance]]
==== Visualizing a Custom Endpoint ====
Here is a view to show a custom endpoint:
[source,html]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/custom-endpoint.vue[lines=17..-1]
----
<1> If you define a `instance` prop the component will receive the instance the view should be rendered for.
<2> Each instance has a preconfigured https://github.com/axios/axios[axios] instance to access the endpoints with the correct path and headers.

Registering the instance view works like for the top-level view with some additional properties:
[source,javascript]
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/src/index.js[tags=customization-ui-endpoint]
----
<1> The parent must be 'instances' in order to render the new custom view for a single instance.
<2> If you add a `isEnabled` callback you can figure out dynamically if the view should be show for the particular instance.

=== Add Custom Header ===
If you need to have custom header information (i.e. displaying staging information or company name) you have the posibility to set properties to enable this.

- **spring.boot.admin.ui.brand**: This should be a HTML snippet that will be put in die navigation header of SBA. The default is `<img src="assets/img/icon-spring-boot-admin.svg"><span>Spring Boot Admin</span>` which displays the SBA icon followed by it's name. You can customize this part. If you decide just to show a custom icon you can do something like this: `spring.boot.admin.ui.brand=<img src="custom/custom-icon.png">`. Remember to deliver the image by providing a ResourceHandler.

+
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class ResourcesConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
        registry.addResourceHandler("/custom/**").addResourceLocations("classpath:/path/in/classpath/to/image/");
    }
}
----
Another possibiliy is to place the image in `META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui`. SBA already registers a resource handler for that location.

- **spring.boot.admin.ui.title**: This is the page title shown in the browser tab.
