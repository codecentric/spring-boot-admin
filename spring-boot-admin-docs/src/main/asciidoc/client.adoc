[[show-version-in-application-list]]
=== Show version in application list ===

To have the version show up in the application list you can use the `build-info` goal from the `spring-boot-maven-plugin`, which generates the `META-INF/build-info.properties`. See also the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-build-info[Spring Boot Reference Guide].

[[jmx-bean-management]]
=== JMX-bean management ===

To interact with JMX-beans in the admin UI you have to include https://jolokia.org/[Jolokia] in your application. In case you are using the `spring-boot-admin-starter-client` it will be pulled in for you, if not add Jolokia to your dependencies:

[source,xml]

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jolokia</groupId>

[[loglevel-management]]
=== Loglevel management ===
For applications using Spring Boot 1.5.x (or later) you can manage loglevels out-of-the-box.
For applications using older versions of Spring Boot the loglevel management is only available for http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback]. It is accessed via JMX so <<jmx-bean-management, include Jolokia>> in your application. In addition you have configure Logback's `JMXConfigurator`:

[source,xml]
.logback-spring.xml
----
include::{samples-dir}/spring-boot-admin-sample/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml[]
----

NOTE: In case you are deploying multiple applications to the same JVM and multiple Logback-JMX-beans are present, the UI will select the JMXConfigurator with the context-name equals to your applications name. In this case you need to set the `contextName` in your logback-configuration.

[[spring-boot-admin-client]]
=== Spring Boot Admin Client ===

The Spring Boot Admin Client registers the application at the admin server. This is done by periodically doing a HTTP post request to the SBA Server providing information about the application. It also adds Jolokia to your application, so that JMX-beans are accessible via HTTP.

TIP: There are plenty of properties to influence the way how the SBA Client registers your application. In case that doesn't fit your needs, you can provide your own `AppliationFactory` implementation.

.Spring Boot Admin Client configuration options
|===
| Property name |Description |Default value

| spring.boot.admin.client.enabled
| Enables the Spring Boot Admin Client.
| `true`

| spring.boot.admin.url
| Comma separated ordered list of URLs of the Spring Boot Admin server to register at. This triggers the AutoConfiguration. *Mandatory*.
|

| spring.boot.admin.api-path
| Http-path of registration endpoint at your admin server.
| `"api/applications"`

| spring.boot.admin.username +
spring.boot.admin.password
| Username and password in case the SBA Server api is protected with HTTP Basic authentication.
|

| spring.boot.admin.period
| Interval for repeating the registration (in ms).
| `10,000`

| spring.boot.admin.connect-timeout
| Connect timeout for the registration (in ms).
| `5,000`

| spring.boot.admin.read-timeout
| Read timeout for the registration (in ms).
| `5,000`

| spring.boot.admin.auto-registration
| If set to true the periodic task to register the application is automatically scheduled after the application is ready.
| `true`

| spring.boot.admin.auto-deregistration
| Switch to enable auto-deregistration at Spring Boot Admin server when context is closed.
| `false`

| spring.boot.admin.register-once
| If set to true the client will only register against one admin server (in order defined by `spring.boot.admin.url`); if that admin server goes down, will automatically register against the next admin server. If false, will register against all admin servers.
| `true`

| spring.boot.admin.client.health-url
| Client-health-url to register with. Can be overridden in case the reachable URL is different (e.g. Docker). Must be unique in registry.
| Guessed based on management-url and `endpoints.health.id`.

| spring.boot.admin.client.management-base-url
| Base url for computing the management-url to register with. The path is inferred at runtime, and appended to the base url.
| Guessed based on `management.port`, service-url and `server.servlet-path`.

| spring.boot.admin.client.management-url
| Management-url to register with. Can be overridden in case the reachable url is different (e.g. Docker).
| Guessed based on management-base-url and `management.context-path`.

| spring.boot.admin.client.service-base-url
| Base url for computing the service-url to register with. The path is inferred at runtime, and appended to the base url.
| Guessed based on hostname, `server.port`.

| spring.boot.admin.client.service-url
| Client-service-url to register with. Can be overridden in case the reachable url is different (e.g. Docker).
| Guessed based on service-base-url and `server.context-path`.

| spring.boot.admin.client.name
| Name to register with.
| `${spring.application.name}` if set, `"spring-boot-application"` otherwise.

| spring.boot.admin.client.prefer-ip
| Use the ip-address rather then the hostname in the guessed urls. If `server.address` / `management.address` is set, it get used. Otherwise the IP address returned from `InetAddress.getLocalHost()` gets used.
| `false`

| spring.boot.admin.client.metadata.*
| Metadata key-value-pairs to be associated with this instance.
|
|===

.Instance metadata options

| Key |Value |Default value

| user.name +
user.password
