== Monitoring Spring Boot Applciations 1.5.x ==

It is possible to monitor Spring Boot 1.5.x applications with Spring Boot Admin 2.x. The old Spring Boot Admin Client is
able to register at a newer server. Since the API has slight changes for you need to set the following property:

. Add reconfigure the api path for Spring Boot Admin Client 1.5.x:
+
[source,yml]
.application.yml
----
spring.boot.admin.api-path: instances
----

As some of the actuator endpoints changed with the Spring Boot 2 release not all options might be available
(e.g. `/metrics` endpoint); for some of the endpoints we provide legacy converters.
